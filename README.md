# Maximum-Stack-Element-Hackerrank

maximum stack element hackerrank problem is stated here in https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/maximum-element/problem

there are two solution for this problem and please check the both of the sol.                                                                   																
1-it's basically the more efficient solution for that problem (MaxStackFull.py)                                                          															
2-it's also a try to implement that problem in more sophisticated approach but it's not that much effiecient in time constraint (MaxStackPartial.py)
